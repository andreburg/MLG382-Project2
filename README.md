## Problem:
__Analyze customer reviews and sentiment data to categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral, providing insights for businesses to improve customer satisfaction.__

It has become difficult for the quickly expanding bookshop to keep track of and evaluate the growing number of customer evaluations for their books. The bookshop is aware of how critical it is to comprehend client sentiment in order to enhance marketing tactics, book selection, and general satisfaction with customers. However with their growing catalogue and client base, it is time-consuming and ineffective to manually evaluate and analyse every review. Their goal is to create an automated sentiment analysis tool that can effectively classify customer evaluations into three categories: neutral, negative, and positive. Through the use of this tool, the bookshop will be able to determine what kinds of books its customers enjoy and find out what they don't and adjust its marketing and stocking strategies appropriately. Their goals are to improve customer satisfaction, keep their competitive edge in the ever-changing book industry, and expedite operations by automating the review analysis process. This business problem is in agreement with the bookstore's requirement to use data analytics to handle consumer feedback and promote expansion. They will be able to use data to their advantage and improve customer service by creating an automated sentiment analysis tool.
