                    "It’s been nearly 25 years since I first curled up in my grandfather’s easy chair as a 10-year old and was mystified by Mr. Dursley’s strange day. It was the start of Christmas vacation when I picked up Harry Potter by chance at a small bookshop in Pompano Beach. This was at the start of the mania in the U.S and only books 1-3 had been published.",
                    "My mother and I arrived at my grandparent’s house around 3pm and I had finished the book by 11pm that night. My grandparents arrived home from a church function around 6pm and I barely acknowledged them. Which was wholly out of character for me. My mom explained to my grandmother that we had picked up a book on the way over and that it must be really good because of the expressions I was making. Around 9pm I remember my mom asked me how much I had left to read because she was going to bed. She told me to hurry up which was impossible because I was already turning the pages faster than my fingers could go. I finally finished a little before 11pm and my mom asked jokingly, “How was it?” I was beaming and I launched into the details immediately. My mother stopped me. “Don’t tell me anymore, off to bed so I can read it!”",
                    "For a few days after that, my mom and I thought we were some of the few people who knew about Harry. The way the first book ends especially if you’re a child and don’t have a lot of experiences by that age with series. You might mistakenly think book1 is all there is. So I spent weeks of my Christmas vacation playing alone in my grandparent’s overgrown backyard pretending to be Harry Potter blissfully unaware more was yet to come. Christmas morning came and I don’t remember anything else I got that year. Because my grandma and mom had realized it was clearly a series. I still remember sitting on my knees in front of the Christmas tree and my grandmother saying “There’s a special gift from Santa just over there…” It was heavy and quite large. I ripped and saw bright green letters glinting. I saw two thick books. I jumped up from the floor (because I was a low-key kind of kid) book in hands and screamed, “Is this Harry!” I also received audiobooks 1and 2 as well. I ran to the guest bedroom with the old tape player and opened up Chamber of Secrets and hit play. I read along with every word. I skipped Christmas lunch and to my mother’s shock pumpkin pie as well. I finished Chamber of Secrets in the same day and read Azkaban over the rest of vacation since it was a good deal larger.",
                    "My grandmother had preordered Goblet of Fire back when she bought my other two books. She relayed to my mother that her friend who ran the bookshop told her that it was expected to sell fast. Neither my mother or grandmother quite believed or understood the level to which Harry Potter was sweeping the nation. They made little comments like, “must be popular or something.”",
                    "I always visited my grandparents for every break so when summer rolled around we were once again at the little mall food court above the bookshop. This tiny mall was nearly always empty and went out of business a few years later. My grandmother wanted to get something from JC Penney and my mom said “I’ll take her to pick up that book.” My mom and I walked a little past the escalators and my mom paused. “Let’s move past all these people” An elderly couple with grey hair wearing black robes turned around to look at my mother with a pleasant smile. “ Line starts here.” “Oh, I’m just taking my daughter to pick up her book.” The woman smiled. “Yes, Harry Potter?” “Yes!” I interjected. The elderly woman smiled at me. “But we preordered?” My mom said slowly. The elderly man laughed “Yeah so did we.” It started to dawn on my mom all at once. “You mean all these people are here for Harry Potter?” The elderly couple in front of us started discussing with other adults wearing cloaks the trip they had planned to the UK to see all the landmarks. My kid brain was overwhelmed. “Mom can we go to London too!” I said excitedly.",
                    "My mom was now actively trying to discourage me from talking to the adults in cloaks. My grandma met up with us confused which was uncommon for her to be. She always knew what do and in this situation she charged forward toward the entrance (dinner was at 6 there wasn’t time for all this) and made a motion at her friend who owned the book shop. She returned quickly with my book and said, “Hide it let’s go!” And we left the line in a hurry! The rest is history as they say. It’s so nice to go back to my 10 year old self. Harry Potter still managed to suck me right back in after all these years.",

                    "Harry Potter looks like your ordinary eleven-year-old kid, and has it much worse than a typical one. Orphaned as a baby, Harry got stuck with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon Dursley, plus his cousin Dudley, the most spoiled and horrible pig of a boy on the planet. With them, Harry leads a miserable existence, until one day an owl brings him a mysterious letter. What the letter contains opens an entirely new world for Harry, one that begins with this enchanting first book in the series.",
                    "I came to the Harry Potter series quite late; I didn't read them as a kid due to the witchcraft controversy, and just never got around to it after that. I finally bought Sorcerer's Stone for my Kindle to see what all the fuss was about...and because, I admit, I've always wanted a little magic in my life in some form. J.K. Rowling does not disappoint. Her writing is geared toward children, so there are some things I would normally object to, such as telling over showing, narrative summary, and the use of adverbs to describe how people do and say things. But again, considering the audience, I'm inclined to let that stuff slide.",
                    "The story itself is, as I mentioned, enchanting. Harry has the perfect pair of eyes through which to view Hogwarts for the first time. Reading this book felt like starting at a new school myself--everything is new and different, there are new friends and adversaries to meet, and adventure waits everywhere. J.K. Rowling does a beautiful job describing and presenting the Hogwarts environment. Harry, Ron, and Hermione deal with typical middle school stuff, such as strict teachers and school bullies. But how many other kids do you know who also bond over getting a mountain troll out of the girls' room? Playing a literally killer game of chess? Smuggling a dragon onto the school roof so it can be transported to safety? Each mini-adventure and plot point is excellently done.",
                    "As for the characters, they're engaging and incite plenty of empathy. This is especially true and important for protagonist Harry. In the beginning, he naturally incites a lot of pathos, but this boy is not a victim. Once he gets his legs under him, and his self-esteem gets a needed boost, he becomes quite the little hero without being obnoxious about it. My favorite scenes definitely involve him standing up to Draco Malfoy, especially for other students like Neville.",
                    "Ron gets a chuckle every now and then, although he's frustratingly impulsive at times. Basically, he's the kind of kid you just want to hug. As for Hermione, I can see her becoming one of my fictitious soul sisters. Like her, I was a diligent and perfectionist student, though I hope for my classmates' sake I wasn't quite that much of a know-it-all. Like Hermione, I also struggled with making friends, but those I have are friends for life. (I'm not gonna lie; I'm kind of mad and disappointed that this isn't the Hermione Granger series).",
                    "J.K. throws in a couple of twists at the end; they're nothing an adult couldn't figure out, but they are enjoyable. I also loved the trio's final adventure as they searched for the Stone, particularly Hermione's talent at solving the logic puzzle. Other highlights for me included the Mirror of Erised, Harry's first Quidditch game against Slytherin, and Hagrid himself, a well-drawn secondary character. He sort of acts as Harry's fairy godfather...or should that be hairy godfather?",
                    "For any parents who might be wondering about the witchcraft element: No worries. What's here is downright tame, if it exists at all. It's mostly kids waving wands around, changing matches into needles, and learning how to fly on broomsticks. The scene in the Forbidden Forest involves some talk of astrology and the slaying of a unicorn, but nothing too intense. Personally, I'm ready to put on my Ravenclaw robes, pick up my fictional wand (beechwood with unicorn core, 10.5 inches, slightly springy) and read the next book.",

                    "I first read this novel several years ago, but had not reviewed it until now. Since I own a copy of \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\", I decided I needed to revisit the series.",
                    "This second reading was just as delightful as the first! This series just has a freshness, an amazing originality, that I know I'll NEVER get tired of!",
                    "Poor Harry Potter has not had an easy life....after all, he's been targeted for bullying and attempted murder. In the first book, not only was he nearly killed by Voldemort, but then grew up being constantly bullied by his nearest relatives, the Dursleys, who are Muggles (non-magical people). Then he started attending the magical boarding school -- Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry -- and found two new enemies: Draco Malfoy, and Professor Snape. All of these characters continue to harass him in this second installment, too.",
                    "Amazingly, Harry manages to deal with it all, including the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart, who is ridiculously narcissistic. And in the end, as always, Harry emerges as hero!",
                    "In this book, there's a new mystery to be solved, as several students, and one cat, are Petrified. This means they're literally turned into statues. At the same time, Harry is hearing something very unusual, that no one else can hear. And a certain villain makes a very unexpected appearance....",
                    "The three main characters are GREAT, as usual. Harry remains resolute in solving any and all strange mysteries that may arise, and he  has two incredible allies in Hermione and Ron, who back him up in all of his adventures! I love how Hermione constantly turns to books as the answer to every problem that crops up. When in doubt, head for the library! As for Ron, I really admire his loyalty to Harry. He's given Harry some very great help along the way, as well.",
                    "All the secondary characters are also wonderful, which is a Rowling trademark. This is very important, as I do feel that secondary characters can either make or break a novel.",
                    "Professor McGonagall, although very strict, is also very fair, as well as compassionate. Professor Snape is his usual nasty, detestable self, constantly directing his unpleasant remarks to Harry. The Weasleys -- especially Fred and George -- are very comical. I love how the whole family accepts and loves Harry, who is an orphan. And Hagrid is his usual sweet, adorable self! In this novel, we find out more about his rather shadowy past.",
                    "Three new minor characters are introduced here -- the house elf, Dobby, Draco's vicious father, Lucius Malfoy, and Professor Gilderoy Lockhart.",
                    "Poor Dobby leads a miserable existence, but, in spite of that, he attempts to warn Harry away from Hogwarts. Unfortunately, for some reason, he's not able to tell Harry exactly why it would be dangerous for him to return to the school. My heart went out to him!",
                    "I thought it was great that Rowling also threaded in some social commentary through this character. But then, she's been doing that since the first book. It's very obvious that she's against abuse of all types, as this is a recurrent theme in the books. Dobby is mistreated by Lucius on a constant basis. Harry is mistreated by the Dursleys, and abused by Draco and Snape. This is one of the elements of the books that, I'm sure, has contributed to their appeal. Rowling definitely sticks up for the underdog!",
                    "The portrayal of Lucius is very well done. He's cruel, despotic, and evil. He might come across as very stereotypical, as Harry's Muggle relative, Uncle Vernon, does, but again, I think Rowling is using some of her characters to speak out against abuse. Unfortunately, children in particular do suffer a lot of abuse worldwide, and so do other groups who have no access to power of any type.",
                    "Through these two characters, Rowling also makes a very important statement regarding bigotry. Lucius (as well as his son, Draco) detests \"Mudbloods\", which is the name given to magical people whose parents happen to be Muggles. Lucius also loathes elves, as they are powerless to change their own status unless someone helps them out. As for Uncle Vernon, he detests magical people. Both characters are constantly judging and stereotyping those who belong to other, \"different\" groups. Both are, of course, insensitive to the suffering of those they unfairly mistreat.",
                    "Gilderoy Lockhart provides a lot of the comic relief in this novel. He is incredibly FOND of himself! He's constantly telling people about his supposed magical exploits, as well as pushing his own books, making these a requirement for the subject he's teaching. It turns out that he's just a ridiculous windbag, but, along the way, he provided a lot of laughs at tense points in the narrative.",
                    "I also loved the character of \"Moaning Myrtle\", even though she was constantly complaining and whining. I do feel sorry for her. She had self-esteem issues while alive, and these continued to plague her even as a ghost. She just had a very raw deal. Even her death was totally unfair. She does help out our heroes, though. Without the clues she provided, they would not have been able to solve the mystery so easily, and lives would not have been saved.",
                    "The novel ended in a very satisfactory manner, as the first book did. Rowling is obviously not a fan of cliffhangers, which is something I really appreciate! Of course, it was Harry who saved the day. In fact, in this particular installment, I was very strongly reminded of Greek mythology. Harry could have been one of the famous Greek heroes, in that he battled some very great obstacles, and used his intelligence and resourcefulness in doing so. I'm sure this was intentional on Rowling's part. She certainly excels at bringing in all kinds of literary allusions to these books!",
                    "Rowling's imagination is amazingly fertile, as she brings in more plot twists, more incredible events, and makes her readers wish even more that they studied and lived at Hogwarts! I find it hard to believe that these books should have met with some negative criticism. After all, they fall squarely into the tradition of the hero who triumphs against all odds! And they do so in an entirely unique and very entertaining way, too!",

                    "I have a fascination with the thought of teaching at Hogwarts though notice they do not seem to have a philosophy course in the curriculum!  Over the last year or so I have read the Harry Potter Books and watched the movies. I listen to the music on the soundtrack CDs while working. It sets a nice mood for me. Why?",
                    "There has been a flurry of writing over the issue of why Potter has been such a hot item. Why do children like to read the books? We have their quotes to read over and think about. Some declare reading them has pulled them away from the abyss and toward success. Adults ponder these issues and offer various reasons why they think they have been so popular with children. Better, they also ponder why the books have been popular with adults as well. Notice that Lady JKR says she wrote the books for herself, because she liked them.",
                    "Some have detailed the perfect fit the stories have with the trends in political and economic aspects of British or American society. Others have described the wonderful use the plots make of classic templates that always win hearts and imaginations. Harry is Jesus made flesh. Those who see a satanic cultus have been pretty much laughed out of town or they live in towns most laugh at.",
                    "We also have the interplay with public relations and the media. Lady JKR received good PR even prior to the first publication of HPP/SS. The news media were interested in the poor single mother making good. It was like magic. Scholastic bid high for the rights in America and that meant a burden was on them to produce fans. They did a good job. But of course, the book was good in its own right. The movie stuck to the text, so to speak. One thing AOL did right. The kids would have been disappointed otherwise. Now when we read we picture things according to the film for better or worse. Frankly, I could never have imagined the delivery of lines such as, \"It does not do Harry to dwell on dreams and forget to live.\" as well as Richard Harris did. Bless him. The irony of it hurts, but it sounds like good advice and one reason to dwell on someone else's dream when it delivers such wonderful insights.",
                    "With so many enjoying the books each for their own reasons, it makes little sense to think there is a peculiarly important reason why the books have enjoyed the overwhelming success they have. There are lots of reasons.",
                    "I do not want the story to stop. It bugged me that I had to wait until June to see the last movie and even longer to find out what happens to Harry next. Book 6 is scheduled to come out July 16, 2005 and my order for it is already placed. But I know I have to be patient. I don't want JKR to feel rushed. I want her to do the job right all the way to the word \"scar.\"",
                    "When I received my order for HPCS, as a side note, I puzzled over this recent development of ordering things before they are published. I have had outstanding orders for about four of five things that have not come out yet. This never used to be the case, at least for me. So this is some new kind of economic development in its own right. I suspect computers had something to do with this. And credit.",
                    "I would love to teach at Hogwarts. Imagine! Students studying. Reading assignments and papers done. Students working at the library. (I seriously think Snape is the best teacher there). Reading books after class on school grounds. Students getting along well in their own houses at least. Competition between houses is a good stressor. Teachers get to teach what they consider important and they don't have to worry so much about their popularity. They can be as strict as they want. In fact, if they are not good enough or strict enough they can lose their positions!",
                    "No more casual clothes. Discipline is the order of the day. All you need to do is deduct points or give detentions, even if those are no longer hanging by the thumbs in the dungeons; they are amazingly effective at Hogwarts. Students really behave. School spirit is great. The school spirits are interesting as well.",
                    "The classrooms look like the pits - well, dungeons at least. At least they are not temporary or make shift! And if they are drafty? Except maybe divination class where it is warm on purpose. Students have sweaters and robes to keep them warm. Cooler is always better for staying awake anyway. Heck, even dead teachers can keep going in a school like this! (See professor Bins in the books.)",
                    "No Internet. Heck, no eklectricity at all in fact. But instead of instant messaging there are instant owls. No spam, though there are occasionally howlers. You never have to find someone's address even if they are hiding from everyone. Owls know where they are. Imagine the possibilities! Message to Osama? Better use a timer if you want your owl back. How would that work?",

They are the kinds of kids we really want. Is this different than the ones we really have? They come to school reasonably prepared even if some of their wands are defective. There is still the pressure on those who would over indulge in intellectualosity-- maybe I should use the word \"lucubrations\". \"This is light?\" \"How can you be behind in your school work? We are on vacation!\" \"She's a nightmare. No wonder she doesn't have any friends.\" But that sort of thing is resolved. \"Thank goodness. Hermione pays attention in Herbology.\" What could be more rewarding than being her teacher?",

Because Harry is awesome. And he just gets more and more awesome. I did not mention Sirius in my last review. But yeah. He is a favorite character of mine. We see a bit more about him in this book. And I loved that a whole lot. He is just incredible :)",
                    "I still love Harry's best friends so much. Hermione is amazing. So kind and clever and just perfect. I wish more people in these books would love her, hmph. And Ron. Sigh. I do adore him. Though he is a bit silly sometimes, and I'm not happy with him not believing Harry. It hurt my heart. And I wish he had truly apologized for it. Yet I also understood why he felt the way he did. But even so. It hurt my heart. But anyway. I adore the friendship between these three amazing kids. It just gets stronger all the time.",
                    "Exciting things are happening at Hogwarts this year. There is a tournament. And it is the most fun and horrifying to read about. Loved every moment of it. The trials are awesome. And awful. And so much fun too. The ball was stunning. Sort of. I love the new characters a lot too. Moody is another favorite of mine, though he wasn't even real in this one. And that bothered me a bit, hmph. I loved the fake one. How rude. But yeah, bunch of amazing new characters in this book. And old ones too. I enjoyed them all.",
                    "I can't say more about this book. Okay, I could probably talk about it a whole lot more, but I'm not going to. Just know that I adored re-reading Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. It is a spectacular book. And I'm so happy I decided to re-read this series. You must all read this book. Harry Potter is amazing. And it gets better for every book. So much happens in this one. More about Voldemort. Shudders. I cannot wait to re-read the next three. And watch the movies again. It will be the best thing, I suppose. I'm excited.",

                    "\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" is the fourth entry in J.K. Rowling's acclaimed Harry Potter series, and it continues to showcase her talent for world-building, character development, and storytelling. In this installment, the author takes the series in a slightly darker and more mature direction, while maintaining the sense of wonder and adventure that has captivated readers of all ages.",
                    "Pros:",
                    "World-building: Rowling's magical world expands even further in this book, introducing readers to new aspects of the wizarding world and its rich history. The book delves into the traditions and customs of different magical schools, offering a broader perspective on the world in which the story is set.",
                    "Character development: The characters continue to grow and evolve in \"The Goblet of Fire.\" The protagonists are faced with new challenges and responsibilities, both magical and personal, which test their relationships and force them to mature. Rowling skillfully explores the nuances of friendship, loyalty, and trust as the characters navigate these challenges.",
                    "Pacing: The novel is well-paced, with moments of suspense and excitement balanced by quieter, character-driven scenes. The story is engaging and immersive, keeping readers eager to find out what happens next without feeling rushed or overwhelming.",
                    "Social commentary: Rowling touches on important themes such as prejudice, discrimination, and power dynamics, adding depth and complexity to the story. These themes are relevant and thought-provoking, encouraging readers to consider their implications beyond the realm of the story.",
                    "Cons:",
                    "Length: Some readers may find the book's length intimidating or feel that certain sections could have been trimmed. However, the richness of the story and the depth of the world-building largely justifies the book's length.",
                    "Tone shift: The darker and more mature themes in \"The Goblet of Fire\" may not resonate with all readers, especially younger fans of the series. While the shift in tone is a natural progression for the story and characters, some may prefer the lighter, more whimsical atmosphere of the earlier books.",
                    "Complexity: The plot of \"The Goblet of Fire\" is more intricate than the previous installments, which may be confusing or off-putting for some readers. However, many fans appreciate the complexity, as it adds depth and intrigue to the story.",
                    "Overall, \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" is an engaging and compelling entry in the series, with a rich and immersive narrative that showcases J.K. Rowling's storytelling prowess. While the darker tone and increased complexity may not appeal to all readers, the novel successfully balances these elements with the charm and wonder that have made the series so beloved",

                    "I will keep this spoiler free, so if I am vague about plot, that is why.  May I suggest that all other reviewers do the same, at least for the first month or two?",
                    "With each passing novel from JKR, I become more apprehensive that she will have lost her touch, that the shine will be gone.  Rest assured, dear readers, that this novel has all the magic, all the excitement, all the adventure that we have come to expect--and more.",
                    "The appearance of darker themes (death, consequences, truly evil villains who have an agenda that is definitely not wholesome) that marked the end of novel four were an unexpected twist for me.  I had heard that this was not a fluke, that she was taking the septology into a serious examination of what happens when someone truly evil rises to power; this is indeed what she appears to be doing.  Serious themes such as these form the backbone of the novel, and are apparent from the first pages.  This disconcerted me a bit, as I was expecting the usual romp through Privet drive, a la Dobby; instead, I got a much different thing.  The New York Times calls this section somewhat \"ponderous\", but I think that that is a specious view.  In reality, it was important to change the tone of the world, and she wanted to make sure that we understood that all was not mandarin oranges and ice cream here.",
                    "  As JKR has admitted in interviews, Harry is much more angry in this novel.  I felt that she handled this reasonably well--she does an excellent job portraying adolescent confusion.  It feels like Harry spends a lot of time being very distressed, but when you imagine yourself, at 15, in his situation, he is not necessarily unrealistic.  Teenage angst has been done better, but seeing this side of Harry is important in understanding how he is growing.",
                    " The plot is where Ms. Rowling really shines.  The Order of the Phoenix his one has significant plot twists where they should be, as well as where you least expect them.  Ron and Hermione are there in spades, and there is significant character development for all the major characters as well as a few minor characters.  We see new sides of McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Black, and Neville.  I was thrilled to see threads from novels 1-4 that seemed unimportant at the time be picked up and woven skillfully into the narrative.  Her grasp of the overall plan for her septology is admirable, and I am pleased that she even more careful a writer than any of us had anticipated.  This is a united whole, a well planned world.  This 7 book series has a definite beginning, middle, and an end, and we are in the thick of things now.",
                    " All the old charm is back as well.  Rowling's wit seems mostly absent for the first 100 pages, but don't give up hope. She was not not attempting to make the first hundred pages funny--she wants us to know she is in deadly earnest.  The wit is always bubbling under the surface, however, and later in the novel, there are a number of laugh out loud funny passages.",
                    " Descriptions, as always, are excellent.  I needn't add that the names of her characters are always interesting, funny, and often revealing.  Spells play an important role, of course, and their magic words never fail to amuse.",
                    " Please note: This is not a novel for 6 year olds.  They won't understand the adolescent issues.  The plot is not as scary as the end of the fourth novel, but the overall tone is dark, as has been much discussed.  Her literary style is much the same as the previous novels, but her vocabulary is becoming more advanced as Harry ages.  This is an excellent novel for the precocious 10 year old; I'm not sure I would let 7-8 year olds read it unless they are exceptionally mature.  No sex, but there is some violence, and as above, the dark themes.",
                    "  Overall, I would say that this is--hands down--her best novel yet.  The climax left me literally breathless, turning pages as fast as I could, unable to believe what I was reading.  I look forward to her 6th installment in this series.",
                    " Well done, Ms. Rowling.  Keep up the amazing work.  Take your time on the next one--it will be well worth it when you do.  And whenever it comes, we'll still be here.",

                    "J.K. Rowling has produced a great adolescent novel. While coming of age stories are staples of both quality and popular literature, modern \"quality\" ones tend to be painfully self-indulgent. A century or so ago, Mark Twain's Huck Finn had the sense to decide that freeing his friend Jim was more important than going to heaven and Dickens' Pip (_Great Expectations_) learned just how foolish had been his self-indulgent adolescence. The writers understood that purpose resides beyond the self. Then, around fifty years ago, critics became enamored with the likes of Holden Caulfield, and the self-indulgent study of adolescent ennui came into fashion.",
                    "Granted, the readers receive a far deeper exploration of Holden Caulfield's psychological makeup than Twain or Dickens ever offered a reader, but we have paid a terrible price for this exploration. Authors and critics stepped forward to claim that solipsistic self-exploration was \"what it's about,\" and few seemed ready to say, \"Yes, this is what adolescence is like, but you've got to step out and take on the world even though the entirety of William James's 'blooming buzzing confusion' seems to be doing its blooming and its buzzing within the confines of your emotions.\"",
                    "Can one experience the confusion of Holden Caulfield and yet set forth boldly as Huck Finn? Harry Potter tries, as the many of us who have not grown up to be self-indulgent agoraphobics have done exactly that. We've sorted through the world, discovered the faults and flaws of the outside world, come to terms with our own weaknesses, and occasionally saved the world (or some tiny little piece of it) in the process.",
                    "Harry Potter is a real adolescent, writ large. He is a wizard; he has a Destiny; he is the hero of childhood fantasy. He is confused, impulsive, traumatized, and full of both anger at the world and self-doubt. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry suffers all the deep pangs that are the fodder of modern literature yet manages to stand true to himself at the end. Harry has heart, and, as Dumbledore notes, that is what matters.",
                    "In the Harry Potter books, Harry tends to create or force the final confrontations. Harry unintentionally cooperates with Voldemort again in this piece, propelled, as always by selflessness rather than malice. Harry may need Voldemort in order to discover what is within himself; Harry also feeds Voldemort as he presses ever greater challenges onto himself, leaving us to ask: is Harry responsible for Voldemort's increasing power and the consequences of these ever more violent confrontations? It is dangerous to act in a world where we posses only incomplete knowledge, but part of Harry�s appeal is that he does act, rather than retreating Hamlet-like into indecision.",
                    "Harry also must discover that his finest role models are not perfect; this is another element of the adolescent rite of passage. Harry, always the underdog in the Muggle world and always the defender of the underdog in the world of wizardry, discovers something unsettling in the form of one of Snape's memories. The revelation explains much of Snape's animosity toward the Potters and Black, and offers Rowling's readers an uncomfortable window into the adolescent world. The more rambunctious behavior of Harry and his friends, throughout the books, has consistently appeared as either benign or justified. In our real world, the behavior of \"good kids\" is all too often neither. Rowling reminds us of the adolescent play that is scarring to all involved: victims, victimizers, and even those who would object but were powerless to do so. And she leaves Harry with the choices of justifying (improperly) his heroes' actions, rejecting his heroes, or accepting that even the best wizards have flaws.",
                    "The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher epitomizes the Dark Art of the Twentieth Century. Those of us who have lived through 1984 may see her as a figure of ultimate evil, one far more depraved than the merely malicious Voldemort. She is the bureaucrat, the agent of societal convenience and unquestioning obedience to authority. All who would argue with her are not merely wrong, they are misguided or deceitful obstacles to the Truth. Order is all, and Order derives only from unquestioned obedience to the rules as delineated by the State. Her methods of punishment are Kafkaesque; her aims include the destruction of independent thought. Question Nothing! It is basic nature for an adolescent to rebel against such a figure; what is difficult is efficacious rebellion, rather than pointless or self-destructive opposition. Can an adolescent learn when to fight and when to pretend acquiescence?",
                    "Yes, this book is dark in tone, raw with the emotions of adolescence and with its external actions a perfect mirror to Harry's confused, angry young mind. In the world of childhood, tomorrow always dawns fresh and new; for an adult, tomorrow's dawn carries the consequences, for good or bad, of the night before. For an adolescent, the dawn is always painful as consequences are a fresh addition to the world, and last night's experiments in living were sure to have produced at least some undesired results. The lessons are intense, the learning rapid, but understanding may be long years away. The brightest thought, and Rowling lets us end with this thought, is that there are others who have felt the pain of adolescence, who have confronted the great human questions, and who have not only survived but have grown into strong, effective adults.",
                    "Harry Potter may be letting a generation of kids know that one's life matters, even in its harshest, most confused periods. It should be letting a generation of critics know that there is more to adolescent self-discovery than simpering self-indulgence. This book suggests that Huck Finn can feel like Holden Caulfield on the inside, yet still behave as Huck Finn. It also suggests that there is no excuse for behaving like Holden Caulfield -- and I like that suggestion.",

                    "This book stands out from the others in the Potter series because it depicts a darker side of Harry Potter, making him feel more realistic and human. In this book, Harry, like most teenagers, experiences a time of teenage angst, proving that, despite becoming a wizard, he is still just a person. The Order of the Phoenix exemplifies one of the top reasons I thoroughly enjoy this series so much: the characters, particularly Harry, aren't perfect. They have flaws and face internal struggles, which adds depth to their personalities and makes them relatable. This book also delves deeper into the complexities of friendship and loyalty, as Harry's relationships with his friends are tested and strained. Overall, the portrayal of Harry's imperfections in The Order of the Phoenix adds a layer of realism that enhances the overall storytelling experience. Even though I thoroughly loved this book, I will admit that there were times when I felt like it went on too long. Harry spends the first 700 pages dreaming about a door, but it isn't until the final 100 pages that he actually goes to that door. Despite my impression that this novel had a lot of buildup and a hurried conclusion, I nevertheless found it to be entertaining. I will say that I completely forgot how much I utterly loathed Umbridge. I was so excited when she finally left; she is honestly the devil. The Half-Blood Prince is the next book in the series, and I am extremely excited to read it. It has always been my Favourite Harry Potter instalment, and I can't wait to get started.",

                    "Half-Blood Prince is easily one of the better books in the Harry Potter series, though each is a masterpiece. But the 6th installment of a 7-part series is bound to be full of great moments in the story. There remains a great deal unanswered in this book, however, and the 7th will surely need to be no smaller than an average encyclopedia. Somehow as I was reading this book, I felt that I was learning more and at a quicker rate than in Order of the Phoenix, but so many of Harry's problems and questions took so long to reach any sort of answer or resolution that I still ended up not knowing many of the secrets I expected to be revealed in this book. It must be that Rowling, in her grand scheme, is saving much for the last book. One thing seems to be for certain, though, and that is that Rowling will never lose that special touch, that supreme and genuine interest in the story and its characters that makes the writing so engrossing. After completing this book, I was in a state of total shock and to this moment I wish only to read the seventh book.",
                    "Half-Blood Prince is dark; I mean far darker than the last. This is the time I have always known was inevitable in the Harry Potter world, at last we are seeing chaos and war and battles break out within the walls of Hogwarts itself. Several of the chapters are particularly well-written, with great suspense and imagery; an example would be the time Harry and Dumbledore spent in the cave. Relationships blossom in this book at last, including Harry suddenly falling in `love' with Ginny Weasley, Ron dating Lavender Brown, Pansy and Draco clearly going out, and some serious hinting at a possible romance between Ron and Hermione when he gets rid of Lavender. Some of the focus on their teenage jealousies and squabbles, and their newfound interest in dating and `snogging,' was a cute touch, but admittedly not what I was exactly looking for. After all, it was more fluff than anything else, and certainly none of it was real love. Then, the useless couple of Tonks and Lupin was introduced in the end; all well and good, I suppose, but again not something that overjoyed me. The end of the book is very sad indeed, yet, I was not crying--I was merely shocked, flabbergasted at the circumstances. A Snapeless, Dumbledoreless Hogwarts that Harry Potter is not intending to return to next year? Yes, you heard right. Harry wants to go off and find all of Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes and face the final battle on his own.",
                    "Much of the book is devoted to Harry witnessing important memories in the Pensieve with Dumbledore so that he can gain a greater understanding of his enemy, the Dark Lord. Now, I have long been a fan of Severus Snape. I admit I love him. Most of my reasons for loving Harry Potter center on him. And while much was learned about him in this book, much is still unknown, and what we do now know is shocking. To begin with, we learn the names of his parents, muggle Tobias Snape and witch Eileen Prince (yes, Snape is the Half-Blood Prince.) It is also known that Snape overheard the prophecy regarding Harry & Voldemort and told the Dark Lord about it; however, supposedly he showed enough remorse after Voldemort used the information to kill Harry's parents that Dumbledore forgave and entrusted him. Many are accusing Dumbledore of naivety for this, but I believe that they are only looking at what is plainly on the surface of this book and forgetting many things. I will explain later why, amazing as it may seem, my love for and faith in Snape remain unshaken despite the fact that this book, from its beginning, seems to be saying that he is still on Voldemort's side. I believe it's too simple for Rowling to be writing that he is, after all, evil. To me it seems a set-up. Additionally, I was expecting a surprising reason for Dumbledore to trust Snape, not a simple apology. There must still be more to this than meets the eye.",
                    "Before I explain my case about Snape, I'll mention some of the things that remain a mystery after this book. Sev's patronus and greatest fear don't come up (in fact, while Tonks' patronus is revealed, Boggarts don't receive any mention.) Some interesting information is supposedly going to be divulged regarding both Lily and Petunia, but neither of them played much of a role in book 6.",
                    "So on to my favorite character, who ends up being the Prince mentioned in the title. When I first finished this book, I was somewhat upset because while I still loved Snape, I was aware that what he'd just done was not steering in the direction of redemption, as I had hoped to see him going. I also knew that, at least until some point in Book 7, almost everyone (in the books and in real life) would turn against Snape and regard him as a treacherous dog. Yet, after composing myself and reviewing what I'd read, I realized that I just cannot accept him as truly evil, or Dumbledore as an old fool.",
                    "Now, before reading this book, if I had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen...Snape killing the Headmaster and fleeing the school with a bunch of Death Eaters, would have been right at the top of the list. But, I'd have been wrong. I had a very strong feeling that Dumbledore would be the one to die in this book. But I never saw the way it happened coming. In the beginning of the story, Snape came in rather quickly. Once Harry was at school, Snape finally got the Defense Against the Dark Arts post he'd longed for. I was cheering. (Yes, he is no longer Potions Master.) But it turned out not to matter. In the second chapter, Narcissa Malfoy and her sister, Bellatrix Lestrange, visit the home of Sev and he makes with Narcissa (possibly out of love) an Unbreakable Vow--that Snape will help her son Draco carry out a task ordered of him by Voldemort, and will complete it himself should Draco prove unable. The task, it seems in the end, was to kill Dumbledore. Draco does prove unable, and Snape carries it out. Yet, it cannot be this simple. Dumbledore may have been aware of the task, and the Vow. From the moment Dumbledore returns from the cave, weakened, having drunk an unknown potion set by Voldemort to guard a Horcrux, he says he needs Severus. He never says what for, never asks to be healed. When Snape arrives Dumbledore calls his name and says 'please' (pleading for his life, as everyone assumes, or something else?) before Snape aims the curse at him that kills him.",
                    "This seems twisted, monstrous, unforgivable, no? Exactly: No. Not in my opinion, at least. I do not think it was Snape's choice to kill Dumbledore, but that the Headmaster had at least one reason for telling him that he must do this horrible deed. Of course from Harry's perspective (Harry, who has inherited, as Lupin says, a prejudice against Sev) it was cold-blooded murder and betrayal and he now wants to destroy Snape as much as Voldemort. But this too is far too simple; clearly, as the book ends on this note, there are things Harry does not understand about what has happened.",
                    "He has forgotten, for instance, about the argument overheard by Hagrid, between Snape and Dumbledore. This point never was addressed again, yet amidst all the turmoil, who can blame it for being overlooked? Consider it. Dumbledore telling Snape he must do something that Snape does not wish to do. For several reasons I can think of (mainly involving the Death Eaters and the Malfoys), this argument connects directly to the death of Albus. And what of the mysterious order given Snape at the end of \"Goblet of Fire,\" at which he turned pale? Clearly he is being asked to do things most difficult, to make great sacrifices; how can the most enigmatic person turn out to be clear-cut evil?",
                    "Read carefully and you'll see that Snape has hatred and revulsion etched into his face when he performs the fatal Avada Kedavra. I see these emotions not as directed at his target, which Harry naturally assumes, but stemming from the act he is about to commit. It never really occurs to Harry that Sev may have been feeling the same things he'd been feeling when he was bound by his promise to force-feed the convulsing Dumbledore, does it? Probably far worse.",
                    "Snape acts rather outrageously for the remainder of his time in the story, not shockingly, yet he refuses to allow any harm to come to Harry (clearly Dumbledore would've wanted that). He seems to be in pain and becomes furious at the mere suggestion that he is a coward--because he has just done the most difficult and least cowardly thing ever asked of him. Dumbledore has repeatedly stated that Harry's life is more important than his own, and that Harry understands less than he. And the facts remain that he has in the past done much good despite his suspicious nature, & that not everything he told Bellatrix about staying loyal to Voldemort can be true. My final point has to do with the words Dumbledore cried while drinking the potion in the cave. I don't know why, but I feel these words are important, and that after the escapade Dumbledore may have known the end was near.",
                    "Thus I rest my case. Avid Harry Potter readers will want to dive into this one, I'm certain, and those who haven't yet discovered it should do so. Only possible complaints? 1) Too short; 2) Not enough anticipated answers given, yet new questions raised, 3) Disturbing ending leaves you frustrated waiting for the next book.",

This is full fledged literature. Stephen King's blurb on the book said as much, and I've been thinking that since I finished book 4.",
                    "I am a recent Potter devotee, I read the series about six months before this book came out. I watched all the hype unfold around book five and thought \"for a kid's book?\" And with that rather close-minded outlook I went about my business... until I found a first edition of \"The Philosopher's Stone\" that somehow found it's way into my Mom's house in Tennessee. That book, I thought was a delightful (I choose my words carefully) romp... every bit worthy young reader's fiction. I picked up the second book in paperback and had similar thoughts, but found that the character development increased very much.",
                    "Already long story short, and already over-long point at it's crux... these books and characters age with the readers who grow up with them. And for those of us who went through these ages already, we glean even more understanding. Rowling has matured the books with the age of their characters. And she has done it brilliantly. These books are geared toward young readers AT THE START, but that is because she knows that young people grow up, and as they do they crave more and more creative plots, and more creative and intriguing characters. The books increase in complexity, density (in a good way), sheer brilliance as they  go on. Each book is essentially five times better than the last. As amazing as a claim that is... it's true. Find out if you havn't by now!",
                    "With the Half-Blood Prince I wasn't expecting much more than the first half of the finish of this (hopefully not the only in this world's) series. I got that and much more. (as I mentioned I will give NO MAJOR spoilers, indeed they may not come as spoilers at all) Character development within this rich world is at it's finest here since it has been in Goblet of Fire (my favorite). We get not only MUCH greater insight into Dumbledore... but into how Lord Voldemort came to be. We get into Voldemort's mind, and we find out how and why we ticks. We see some very clevar development for (What I guessed since book 2) what the main character's love interests would be. Though many see it coming, it's because we've watched the relationships unfold. That part isn't meant to shock us.",
                    "Truly this is Harry Potter's last youthful romp I'm afraid... he does a lot of maturing in this book, and rightfully so, he faces more dangers and challenges than ever... and not even in the most obvious forms. Along the way a character we are meant to mistrust from the beginning, but somehow trust all along shows his true color... at least we think so. And one we've hated since the beginning shows his... and it's shocking as well. Rowling at this point, like all genius authors, uses what you know about her and her books against you. She layers the usual form of her book with extra layers that you have to read VERY deeply to understand. The narrative can literally, somehow impossibly, let you know what is REALLY going on without ever putting it on the page. You can FEEL what is going on before being told, sometimes you are proven right, sometimes wrong... and sometimes even more right that you first imagined.",
                    "To all of those complaining that Rowling is drawing the series out, I say that she's planned on seven books from the start, and you've known that all along... if you were expecting book six to be the end, and seven to be the prologue, you've not been paying attention to her style. After seeing what the author pulled off in each concurrent book, upping the ante, the class, and sheer brilliance in each and every narrative and story... I'm fully confident in saying that I KNOW that book seven will do just as each other book before it has done... it will only get better. I'm ready NOW to pre-order book seven by God... and I'm quite sure that Rowling wouldn't even have begun it yet! (The only other authors who can claim that of me are Neil Gaiman and Dan Simmons)",
                    "The only bad thing about this book is finishing it and realizing that there is only one more book to go... I do not want this story to end, but I cannot wait to see how it will finally wrap up. Especially after this thrilling volume. It becomes more painful with each reading of each book to know that it just has to end.",
                    "to J.K. Rowling... welcome to the list of legendary authors... you are truly one of the greats now, and the books that you've written will live on as long as there are people to read them. Here's hoping you don't stop with book seven. And here's to you, one of the greatest authors of my time. It is my honor to read your works.",
                    "And as for the review summary... Well I'll just say that the prose is fluid, and the story runs and winds like a swiss watch. It would be a shame for ANYONE to miss out on this book. Do yourself a favor if you've not yet fallen into the Harry Potter series... buy them all. I'll be passing them along my family. True literature is so hard to come by, but Rowling makes it seem like it comes effortlessly.",

                    "The evening prior to the book's release, my daughter attended a Potter party at a Barnes & Noble book store.  She is not a fan - she likes the movies, but she's not a fan of science fiction or fantasy, and has refused to read the books.  Okay.  She's entitled to her tastes.  But she attended the party because some of her friends are Potter fans.  I sat home, jealous that I wasn't a teenager and therefore way too old to attend a Potter party.  I should have gone, I regret not going - the last of the Potter hooplas, the last Hallow's Ball.  At any rate, my daughter brought home a wand and some Potter glow-in-the-dark eye glasses for me. I would like to have gone, but how sad is it to see a 40-something woman dressed as a witch for a Potter party?  Perhaps not sad at all, but I feared being the oldest witch at the party...",
                    "At midnight, I leaped from my seat and counted down the 60 seconds to the 12:01am mark of release of the book.  My husband, who is use to my insane moments such as this, simply looked at me and nodded off.",
                    "The next day - delivery day! - I cleaned every square inch of my house waiting for the UPS delivery van to pull up and bring me my book.  I started cleaning at 8am... the book arrived at 4pm.  A full day of scrubbing everything around me in a vain attempt to make the time go faster so that the book would finally arrive.  I knew that once the book did arrive, nothing would get done.",
                    "I had two hours to read the opening chapters of the book, because we had planned to make an excursion to a drive-in movie theater that evening to see the Order of the Phoenix movie.  I very reluctantly put the precious book down for the evening.",
                    "Sunday, July 22nd:  the day I was able to spend every waking hour with Harry Potter and Co.  I gathered the book, a bottle of water, a blanket and pillow, and headed out to my backyard where I have a hammock which hangs by a stream, overlooking a deep patch of woods.  My own Forbidden Forest, of sorts.",
                    "It is now Tuesday afternoon, and the book is completed.  I spent some time re-reading chapters before completing the book, just to make sure I had fully absorbed everything.",
                    "It is a wonderful book, it answers just about everything you'd want answered.  There are some questions which are left open, and perhaps JKR did this to keep alive the discussions, or perhaps these questions are answered already (and the books need to be re-read).  But mostly everything you'd want answered is indeed answered, albeit some things are way off from what many of us believed.  Some, however, are right on.  I recall several times yelling outloud, \"I knew it!\"  There were MANY times when I sat here with a hand over my mouth, in stunned awe at what I was reading.  And still, there were plenty of times I burst out crying.",
                    "No disappointment in the way this book was written, the way the whole story comes to its fruition, or the way the characters who survive, survive.  And that little \"crack\" that JKR says she slipped in there incase she wanted to return to the 'wizarding world?'  Yes, I even liked that (I don't normally).  It works.  It all works.  It all makes perfect sense, and it could not have ended any other way.",
                    "Thank you - thank you - thank you - JKR.  Thank you for such a wonderful fantasy, a wonderful world and this awesome, incredible boy, Harry Potter.  Thank you.",

Good versus Evil. Love versus Hate. The Seeker versus the Dark Lord.",
                    "10 years in the making, from the Greek myths to Dickens and Tolkien to \"Star Wars.\" And true to its roots, it ends with good old-fashioned closure: heart-racing, bone-chilling confrontation and an epilogue that clearly lays out people's fates. Getting to the finish line is not seamless -- the last part of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\" the seventh and final book in the series, has some lumpy passages of exposition and a couple of clunky detours -- but the overall conclusion and its determination of the main characters' story lines possess a convincing.",
                    "With each installment, the \"Potter\" series has grown increasingly dark, and this volume is no exception. While Ms. Rowling's astonishingly limber voice still moves effortlessly between Ron's adolescent sarcasm and Harry's growing solemnity, from youthful exuberance to more philosophical gravity, \"Deathly Hallows\" is, for the most part, a somber book that marks Harry's final initiation into the complexities and sadnesses of adulthood.",
                    "From his first days at Hogwarts, the young, green-eyed boy bore the burden of his destiny as a leader, coping with the expectations and duties of his role, and in this volume he is clearly more high-spirited war games of Quidditch have given way to real war, and Harry often wishes he were not the de facto leader of the Resistance movement, shouldering terrifying responsibilities, but an ordinary teenage boy -- free to romance Ginny Weasley and hang out with his friends.",
                    "Harry has already lost his parents, his godfather Sirius and his teacher Professor Dumbledore (all mentors he might have once received instruction from) and in this volume, the losses mount with unnerving speed: at least a half-dozen characters we have come to know die in these pages, and many others are wounded or tortured. Voldemort and his followers have infiltrated Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic, creating havoc and terror in the Wizard and Muggle worlds alike, and the members of various populations -- including elves, goblins and centaurs -- are choosing sides.",
                    "No wonder then that Harry often seems overwhelmed with disillusionment and doubt in the final installment of this seven-volume. He continues to struggle to control his temper, and as he and Ron and Hermione search for the missing Horcruxes (secret magical objects in which Voldemort has stashed parts of his soul, objects that Harry must destroy if he hopes to kill the evil lord), he literally enters a dark wood, in which he must do battle not only with the Death Eaters, but also with the temptations of hubris and despair.",
                    "Harry's weird psychic connection with Voldemort (symbolized by the lightning-bolt forehead scar he bears as a result of the Dark Lord's attack on him as a baby) seems to have grown stronger too, giving him clues to Voldemort's actions and whereabouts, even as it lures him ever closer to the dark side. One of the plot's significant turning points concerns Harry's decision on whether to continue looking for the Horcruxes -- the mission assigned to him by the late Dumbledore -- or to pursue the Hallows, three magical objects said to make their possessor the master of Death.",
                    "Harry's journey will propel him forward to a final showdown with his arch enemy, and also send him backward into the past, to the house in Godric's Hollow where his parents died, to learn about his family history and the equally mysterious history of Dumbledore's family. At the same time, he will be forced to ponder the equation between fraternity and independence, free will and fate, and to come to terms with his own frailties and those of others. Indeed, ambiguities proliferate throughout \"The Deathly Hallows\": we are made to see that kindly Dumbledore, sinister Severus Snape and perhaps even the awful Muggle cousin Dudley Dursley may be more complicated than they initially seem, that all of them, like Harry, have hidden aspects to their personalities, and that choice -- more than talent or predisposition -- matters most of all.",
                    "It is Ms. Rowling's achievement in this series that she manages to make Harry both a familiar adolescent -- coping with the frustrations of school and dating. This talent has enabled her to create a narrative that effortlessly mixes up allusions to Homer, Milton, Shakespeare and Kafka, with silly kid jokes about vomit-flavored candies, a narrative that fuses a plethora of genres (from the boarding-school novel to the detective story to the epic quest) into a story that could be Exhibit A in a Joseph Campbell survey of mythic archetypes.",
                    "In doing so, J. K. Rowling has created a world as fully detailed as L. Frank Baum's Oz or J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, a world so minutely imagined in terms of its history and rituals and rules that it qualifies as an alternate universe, which may be one reason the \"Potter\" books have spawned such a passionate following and such fervent exegesis. With this volume, the reader realizes that small incidents and asides in earlier installments (hidden among a huge number of red herrings) create a breadcrumb trail of clues to the plot, that Ms. Rowling has fitted together the jigsaw-puzzle pieces of this long undertaking with Dickensian ingenuity and ardor. Objects and spells from earlier books -- like the invisibility cloak, Polyjuice Potion, Dumbledore's Pensieve and Sirius's flying motorcycle -- play important roles in this volume, and characters encountered before, like the house-elf Dobby and Mr. Ollivander the wandmaker, resurface, too.",
                    "The world of Harry Potter is a place where the mundane and the marvelous, the ordinary and the surreal coexist. It's a place where cars can fly and owls can deliver the mail, a place where paintings talk and a mirror reflects people's innermost desires. It's also a place utterly recognizable to readers, a place where death and the catastrophes of daily life are inevitable, and people's lives are defined by love and loss and hope -- the same way they are in our own mortal world.",

Rather than grieving and moving on, Zara decides she will do whatever it takes to claw her sister back from the grave—even trading in the occult.Jude Wolf may be the daughter of a billionaire, but she is also undeniably cursed. After a deal with a demon went horribly wrong, her soul has been slowly turning necrotic. It’s a miserable existence marred by pain, sickness, and monstrous things that taunt her in the night.

                    "This book reads like Sutherland finished reading “The Power” by Naomi Alderman and said hold my beer I can do it better. I was reading this book because she genuinely made me care about her characters in a way that alderman simply could not. This book is both a social critique and a love letter to women from a woman validating generations of female rage brought on by circumstances and men beyond their control. It is political without shoving it it you face, it brings you face to face with the violence that women, even trans women, have suffered and it unapologetically makes you look at it but it doesn’t beat you over the head with it. The characters are amazing and lovable as well as relatable, the signature horror and violence that this author brings to the table is there in full force and it is done so well. At the end you get great twists and turns and violence but then also a glimpse of happiness that feels very deserved and earned and not just thrown in to appease an audience. After all the violence and misery, these characters deserve a little bit of joy and it feels right. Every manner of woman is represented here, rich, poor, abused, starved, lonely, lost, murdered, all of them get a little retribution through this author’s story and it just does it so well. I recommend this to anyone. Everyone. It’s so much more than necromancy and demons and spells, it’s women. Women and how they carry society in secret small ways while also doing big hard things. It’s amazing. I loved it.",

                    "Zara wants to bring her beloved sister back from the grave. She regrets the last words she spoke to Savannah were bitter and unkind. As a novice witch, Jude’s deal with a demon resulted in tragic consequences that she’s desperate to correct. Both girls are fortunate to come across Emer, who comes from a family of witches and potentially possesses the powers to help them.",
                    "With three POVs, distinct characterization is a must, and this author masters that aspect. Zara seeks knowledge in books and is generally more trusting of them than people. Jude believes her charm and wit will get her what she needs – if those fail she’ll use her wealth. After being on her own since the age of seven, Emer is fiercely independent and doesn’t allow anyone to get close. Put the three of them on a path to discover the identity of a serial killer, and they make a formidable team. What they don’t initially understand is the amount of power the killer commands. Saying it’s a dangerous, life-threatening mission is an understatement.",
                    "Maybe I was slow to put it together, but the identity of the killer was a mystery to me until nearly the end. It doesn’t happen often, and I liked it. Over the course of the story, Zara, Jude, and Emer become friends (and a little more with two of them) and a kind of family – which each of them desperately needs. Jude comes from a large family but she’s estranged from most of them. You’ll realize why after meeting them. Emer’s family was killed by witch hunters when she was a child. Zara’s last remaining family is an uncle barely more than ten years her senior, and he’s not a good guy. My heart went out to each of them.",
                    "This is a dark and occasionally gory story that’s also full of action and witty banter. It held my interest from the first page, but after a certain point I couldn’t put it down. Recommended for readers who enjoy strong female protagonists, a found family trope, and sinister paranormal mysteries.",

                    "“The Invocations” tells the story of three interconnected young women as a serial killer rampages through a community of witches. Zara Jones only began believing in magic and witches after the violent murder of her sister Savannah, because the alternative is that her death was just random violence. Unable to cope with her loss, Zara turns to the occult to bring Savannah back from the dead no matter the cost. At the same time, Jude Wolf- the black sheep child of the Wolf billionaire dynastic family- has problems of her own: having made multiple risky deals with demons, she is now irreversibly cursed. Her body is beginning to fall apart, everything around her dies and breaks, and at night she hears voices mocking her as her soul is devoured. Jude refuses to give up however as she’s never had a problem that money can’t solve. Soon enough both women find a solution in Emer Bryne, the daughter of a curse-making family murdered when she was a child. Emer has made herself a reputation for providing spells to women to protect themselves in desperate situations so long as they’re willing to sacrifice some of their souls. However, it soon becomes clear that the violent murders of five women are all connected: they were all her clients at some point. Teaming up to find the serial killer before he can strike again in exchange for Emer’s help, Jude, Emer and Zara soon find themselves the target of the same person they’re hunting.",
                    "I adored this book and I found it hard to put it down whenever I had to do something. Each of the women in this book are brilliant characters on their own- I loved Zara’s determination, Emer’s devotion to helping women and Jude’s genuine belief that she’ll be okay- but together they shine so brightly despite their differences. This is set against the background of bloody murders against women, and it delves deeper into the issues of misogyny, female rage, chronic pain, queer relationships, grief and magic. I particularly loved one section where magic and demons are discussed as only being available to women, which raises the question about trans women; in the world of “The Invocations” the answer is immediate and never debated, the demons see souls and not bodies. I loved how casually inclusive this book was, with beautiful LGBT representation as well as the depiction of chronic pain. Although this is a book about a serial killer, I found this massively enjoyable to read and never ended up feeling dragged down. There’s a wonderful sense of humour from Jude which balances out the story so well, and I could never have predicted the ending. One reason I picked this book up was because of the gorgeous cover but inside I found a thrilling, dark story about female friendship and revenge that will stay with me.

Featuring a dozen animals (beaver, great white shark, narwhal, elephant, rattlesnake, naked mole rat, hippopotamus, crocodile, and more), this book explores how different teeth are especially adapted for an animal's survival. At the end of the book, children will discover why their own teeth are just right for them. And they'll also get a friendly reminder to take good care of their teeth, because they're the only teeth they'll ever have. Each spread features a photograph of the animal using its specialized teeth on the left and a humorous illustrated image of a child using that animal's teeth on the right. \n\n\n \n\nRead more\n\n\n\nRead less\n\n ",

Now, he and his friends have just ten days to find and return Zeus's stolen property and bring peace to a warring Mount Olympus.

Also, some parts have been left out. Important parts that set up the future books.

I love the English language and am actually a linguistics genius, but I have always preferred the visual aspect of media and entertainment. However, while I am one of the few who actually enjoyed the film version (to an extent), I wasn't really pleased with some of the aesthetics, and I did not appreciate some of the casting choices either, Annabeth Chase being one of the bigger ones. With that being said, I was actually ecstatic when I learned that there may possibly be a TV adaptation of the series, and I ordered this set to get an idea of the art style behind the characters, and this novel served that purpose beautifully. I will admit that some of the characters look a little more...developed, for their ages, but it's nice to get an idea of where the TV adaptation can go and, for that, I applaud these graphic novels wholeheartedly.",

Now Alina will enter a lavish world of royalty and intrigue as she trains with the Grisha, her country’s magical military elite—and falls under the spell of their notorious leader, the Darkling. He believes Alina can summon a force capable of destroying the Shadow Fold and reuniting their war-ravaged country, but only if she can master her untamed gift. As the threat to the kingdom mounts and Alina unlocks the secrets of her past, she will make a dangerous discovery that could threaten all she loves and the very future of a nation.

As with many popular books, they have the tendency to have all the same qualities. Not this one. Shadow and Bone is like nothing I have ever read. I can't wait to finish the trilogy.  Pick up this fantastic series today! It's fresh, unique, and filled with action.",
                    "Alina Starkov is an orphan. She was an abused child living in a house with a wretched duke, and cared for by an even more horrible lady, named Ana Kuya. Alina's life was drained of love. But when Mal , another orphan, shows up they immediately have a deep connection. Mal and Alina's relationship lays the foundation for this novel. They are the center that holds the world together. Mal  is the only person that Alina can rely on. He is her rock. Alina has been in love with him since the beginning.",
                    "The fictional world of Shadow and Bone is incredible. It's kind of hard to explain, though. Basically you have the country of Ravka, which is separated by the Unsea, or the Shadow Fold. The Shadow Fold was created hundreds of years ago and contains killer creatures called Volcra. Volcra are flying creatures that used to be the people living in the area before the Fold was created.",
                    "Mal and Alina are both stationed near the fold in the First Army. Mal is a tracker and Alina is a mapmaker. This isn't a normal military base though. In Bardugo's world, there are Grisha. The Grisha are people with powers. They live in the Little Palace and are treated like royalty. However, the less important or powerful Grisha serve in the army, as well. There is a very distinct line between normal humans and Grisha. They do not associate with each other.",
                    "During Alina and Mal's service, they travel with an army into the Shadow Fold. This is a daunting task that will have many casualties. Not even the Grisha can protect the army from the dangerous Volcra. Mal and Alina are both at the brink of death. Their skin torn from the Volcra's sharp claws. As Alina's life slips, a bright light as large as the sun shines out of Alina herself.",
                    "When Alina comes too, she finds herself in the Grisha tent. Confused, she tries to play off what happened on the ship. There was no way she could be Grisha. She had been tested as a child and wasn't. There was simply no way. But the Darkling has other views on the situation. The Darkling is the leader of the Grisha. He is the ruler of the Little Palace and corresponds with the King himself. He has dark gray eyes and a handsome smile that everyone seems to fancy.",
                    "The Darkling is also an amplifier. Meaning he can increase the power in a Grisha significantly. Items can also be amplifiers, and this comes into play a little bit later. The Darkling takes Alina into his grasp, and again, she lights up like the sun. The word choice and imagery that Bardugo uses in this part of the story is incredible. Having a girl light up brightly may seem a little odd, but the way that the author beautifully explains it makes is magical. The Darkling pronounces Alina as the Sun Summoner. She is destined to team up with the Darkling and eradicate the Shadow Fold entirely.  She is taken away from camp, away from Mal, and to the Little Palace, to live her life as  a Grisha",
                    "Alina is revered at the Little Palace. She is prayed to and touched carefully. The Darkling goes to great lengths to protect Alina from harm. She is too important to risk. Without her and her light, there is no way to cross and destroy the Fold. This is the Darkling's only goal.",
                    "Alina knows how important it is that she learn to use her powers. She needs them to help the Darkling! In her various lessons, she fails. Whether it is with her powers or in hand to hand combat. She lacks behind the other Grisha in everything, even theory. Alina misses Mal terribly and writes to him every week. However, she never receives a reply.",
                    "Bagrha is Alina's teacher. She helps her control her power and pushes her incredibly hard. Almost too hard. There are times when the Darkling comes in and snaps at Baghra for pushing Alina too hard. The Darkling and Baghra have a very tense relationship, and Alina wants to know why. The Darkling and Alina have been getting closer and closer. But when she asks about Baghra, the Darkling just shrugs it off.",
                    "Alina's only friend in the Little Palace is Genya. Genya is one of the lower classes of Grisha. She is able to change the appearance of a person. Her main project is with the queen, because the queen always has to look good, right? Genya also helps Alina look better after her stressful days.  Genya and Alina often eat dinner together and discuss the Little Palace as friends often do.",
                    "The other Grisha aren't so inviting to Alina. As the Sun Summoner, she works alone. Other Etherealki (a type of Grisha that controls the elements) usually work in pairs or groups, which makes Alina the odd one out. She also receives special treatment from the Darkling. For example, each Griash wears a Kefta. This is a large jacket or wrap that they wear. The different colors represent the different category of Grisha. Black is the Darkling's color, and he wants Alina to wear it too. Even thought it is a great honor, Alina turns it down. Eventually the Darkling gives her a black Kefta without asking her.",
                    "I really liked reading about Alina's time in the Little Palace. It was interesting to learn about all the Grisha that lived there. They all have such unique qualities, but are really relatable. Genya falls for a man that is plain, when she is the most beautiful Grisha there is. The other Etherealki, as Alina describes them, are fake. They act like the common high school girl today. Sucking up to the most popular and talking bad about people behind their backs.",
                    "Now let's talk about the most interesting part of Alina's stay at the Little Palace.",
                    "The Darkling and Alina's relationship.",
                    "When the Darkling first kissed Alina, I felt like it had taken him long enough. They obviously had some tension going on. Alina was strongly attracted to the Darkling, as were many people. She never told anyone what was really going on between them. In this part of the book I really liked the Darkling. He was dark (obviously) and mysterious. There were secrets in his eyes that the readers wanted to know. But these secrets were more horrible than anyone could imagine.",
                    "One of the best parts of the book is the Ceremony held for the Grisha. When the Darkling and Alina step on stage in their black keftas. They put on a show of interweaving light and dark. It is described so beautifully. At this point, the Darkling and Alina's magic flow together like it was destiny.",
                    "Next in the story we learn about the Stag. Going back to what I said about amplifiers being objects. This isn't a ordinary Stag. It is part of a herd that is said to be legend. If Alina kills the Stag, the antlers can be used as an amplifier so she can use her power freely. She is still having difficulty in her classes with Baghra and there is no time to waste. She needs this amplifier. The Darkling thinks it was made for her.",
                    "Now it's time for the plot twist! So if you are reading this review and have not read the book, please read it. It will be much more fun.",
                    "Was I the only one who didn't see the twist coming. The only one who actually liked the Darkling? I simply can't be alone, right? Of course I knew there would be some kind of twist that drew Alina back to Mal, otherwise what was the point of having their relationship in the beginning!? I knew there was going to be a twist, but wasn't expecting this. Come on, me, his name is Darkling for Pete's sake.",
                    "So the Darkling has been lying. He isn't planning on destroying the Shadow Fold. He is planning on extending it. Baghra pulls Alina  from her room and tells her she has to run. This moment was so intense. I trusted the Darkling's words. I didn't see anything that told me not to. I am sure that a re-read would warrant a lot of reasons though. But in this moment, i felt exactly as Alina did. Scared and betrayed and alone.",
                    "Baghra tells Alina everything she couldn't tell her before. She is the Darkling's mother. She knew about his evil plans the whole time, but knew that he couldn't do it without the Stag. She didn't believe in the Stag at all, so she didn't think there was a reason to panic. But a powerful tracker has located the Stag, and it was just a matter of time until the plan would be revealed by the Darkling himself. She urges Alina to run, because the Darkling is pure evil. He created the Fold in the first place, and now, he wants to rule the world with it.",
                    "I couldn't believe any of the words I had read. I just stared at my Kindle for a few moments. Wait...what? What about the kisses and the moments that Alina and the Darkling shared? I admit that I like Mal more than the Darkling, but it was still an intriguing relationship. And the way it was written was just flawless. I was sad to see it go, but if the Darkling had been lying about his goals, he wasn't good for Alina anyway.",
                    "Alina runs. She escapes the Little Palace and heads toward the mountains-the last place she heard the Stag being mentioned. The Darkling's plot has a lot of terrifying aspects. For one, he is planning on killing the Stag himself and forcing the horns on Alina.  By doing this, he will have complete control of her powers, and can use the light to escape the Volcra, and use his own power to extend the Fold and seize power.",
                    "Alina spends days freezing to death in the mountains. She knows she will never find the Stag on her own. Thankfully, she runs into our heroic Mal. The guy we were waiting over half the book to make his daring return. He does. He more than does. Mal and Alina's reunion is amazing. They tell each other about their feelings. it turns out Mal never received the mail from Alina, so he assumed the worst. There were rumors that she was being tortured, so he teamed up with the Grisha to help find the Stag. He knows the location, and had to  lead the entire tracking crew in the wrong direction.",
                    "I didn't think this fantasy book would be so centered on their romance. Mal and Alina have a great story to tell. It wasn't some cheesy love at first sight thing. They had chemistry. They had a lot of it. The tension between them was even more than Alina and the Darkling.  I love the friendship of Mal and Alina. It was a delightful addition to the plot. They reminisce about the time spent with Ana Kuya. While with Mal, Alina has an epiphany.",
                    "Yes, she was tested to see if she was Grisha as a child. She felt the power being pulled out against her will. however, she realized what this meant. It meant a separation from Mal. She would never see him again. He would be here all alone. She faught against the amplifier with everything she had inside her. And for some crazy reason. It worked. She loved Mal enough to hide her Grisha abilities. She hid the fact from herself. She told herself she was human so many times that she started to believe it.",
                    "Alina and Mal search for the Stag together. During the journey, Alina asks an uncomfortable favor from Mal. More than uncomfortable, it was devastating. Alina knows what will happen if the Darkling finds the Stag and puts the antler collar on her. She will have no choice to obey. To guide him in it mad search for power. She asked Mal to killer her before the Darkling got ahold of her. It was a really deep moment for the two of them and their relationship. She asked the for the one thing that he could not supply. But he agreed anyway.",
                    "When they find the Stag, Mal goes to bring it down. Alina has a split second to make the kill, because the Darkling and his forces are close. So , so close. And Alina can't do it. She can't kill the helpless animal. In this moment of weakness, the Darkling arrives and murders it. The life drains out of the Stag and the Darkling demands the antlers be cut to make the amplifier. Alina and Mal are taken hostage. The collar is places around Alina's neck and the Darkling takes control.",
                    "The group makes a return to the Little Palace. Nobody knows the real reason that Alina left. She begs the Darkling to show mercy to Mal, and he refuses. He tells Alina that Mal will be left in the Fold to die.",
                    "The night that Alina spends in the jail cells with Mal was very touching. They could only hold hands through the bars. The destruction of Mal was coming, and there wasn't anything either of them could do to change it. This moment in their relationship was heartbreaking. I had fallen in love with Mal, and was going to be devastated if something happened to him.",
                    "When the group of Grisha and soldiers make their way out onto the Fold, we witness the true horror of the Darkling. As he uses Alina to take out the Volcra, he is completely ruthless. After this night on the boat, the Darkling is one of my most hated villains in fantasy. Alina is a fighter. She fights every time the Darkling takes her powers. It's just not enough. The Darkling uses his own powers and extends the Fold into the nearby village. At this second, he turns into a true monster. He kills everyone in the village to extend the Fold. He leaves them to the Volcra.",
                    "The Darkling's character development is surreal. He is horrifying and terrible. He acts in a strange and calm manner, which just makes it worse. He went from a leader that I respected to an awful, merciless monster. The other Grisha are surprised by the plan of the Darkling, but nobody will help Alina. She must fight this battle on her own.",
                    "Mal is tossed out of the boat and the Darkling forces Alina to pull her light away from him, leaving his to the ravenous Volcra. Alina isn't finished, though. Her second epiphany is ever more powerful than the first. She realizes that she has the right to the amplifier collar as much as the Darkling does. She showed the Stag mercy, which the Darkling would never be able to do. Mercy wins over murder. She finds her power again. The Darkling's grasp is easy to shrug off and she rescues Mal, leaving the ship and the Darkling to die in the Fold.",
                    "This book was fantastic. It deserves every star it got. I am thrilled to read more from Leigh Bardugo. This author is so talented. This world was painted with love, friendship and power. Shadow and Bone is a rare piece of work. It's one of those books that you can read over and over and over. I recommend it to everyone, not just fantasy fans. It has everything. Action, adventure, romance and twists. Pick up a copy because you won't regret it. Join Mal, Alina, and the wretched Darkling in the adventure of a lifetime.",

                    "Shadow and Bone transports you into a world as fantastic as it is dark. The story takes place in a snow bound version of ancient Russia, a land haunted shadows and demons.  There are things that lurk in the dark places of this world that thirst for blood and dream of rending flesh.  The world building here was nothing short of breath taking.  Every scene in the book was perfectly drawn out in beautiful language. Leigh's prose transports you through the pages of her book into the world she created.  Her characters possess magic that is both unique and beautifully cinematic.  Skeins of shadow shoot out from clasped hands, engulfing and consuming enemies.  Characters explode in blazing white light, piercing darkness, and rending creatures of shadow.",
                    "There are layers upon layers and twists galore in the plot of this novel.  The story is complex and intricate.  Alina's training takes her into the capitol city, where childlike and corrupt king sits on the throne beside a vapid queen.  Hovering behind the king like a spider is a seemingly mad priest with his own agenda.  Then we have The Darkling, the most powerful Grisha (mage) alive, who also controls the military.  All these players seem to be vying for power, struggling for control.  It's left to us as readers to distinguish the puppets from the puppet masters.  The villains from the saviors.",
                    "While Shadow and Bone's greatest strengths lie in its world and intricate plot, I felt its greatest failing was Alina herself.  She felt weak to me.  There's a fine line between giving writing characters with failings that serve as growth opportunities and writing characters so weak they frustrate the reader.  Ultimately we expect characters in fantasy stories to have something heroic in their nature.  They may be flawed and broken, but there's something about them (who they are not just the powers they wield) that makes them epic, and worthy of our admiration.  Alina had amazing powers, but there was nothing about her that inspired me, or made filled me with admiration.  I'm not saying she was unlikeable, she just wasn't heroic.  She fights her destiny tooth and nail in the beginning, insisting she possesses no magical powers, despite all evidence to the contrary.  There's a point in her training where she just gives up trying, complaining that things are just too hard.  Over and over the story throws challenges her way, obstacles to be overcome, and she consistently backs down, gives up, or fails.  Sadly, the greatest success she experiences was one that seemed almost accidental, a challenge she fails but a twist of fate ends up turning her defeat into a victory. As a character reader, that appreciates strong heroines, this element of the story seemed like a failing, thus Alina is the main reason I gave Shadow and Bone four stars instead of a resounding 5.",
                    "While Alina did not resonate with me, I'm happy to report I loved all of the other characters. The strongest most well developed and interesting character in this story is the Darkling.  He's centuries old, powerful, and deliciously mysterious. His motivations are difficult to ferret out and his aims are unclear.  I spent an entire book getting to know his character, but still feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what makes him tick.  He's an incredibly complex man.  One moment he's warning Alina to not expect fairness from him.  The next he shows surprising tenderness and even kindness.  He seems to care what Alina thinks about him, and even seems hurt by careless things she says.  He is drawn to her and at the same time repelled by his own feelings.  He's dark, multifaceted, and utterly fantastic.",
                    "The romance in this story is full of as many twists and turns as the plot, and it's another area where the story didn't quite work for me (at least in the beginning).  There is a love triangle but it's executed in a way that spares you the most painful and annoying elements of triangles.  There's never a time when both men are actively fighting over Alina.  Darkling is of course one of the contenders to Alina's heart (and my favorite). The other leg of the triangle is Alina's childhood friend Mal.  He starts the story as a womanizer that barely recognizes Alina as a member of the female species, much less a desirable part of that species.  He's her friend but nothing more.  Mal's inability to really see and appreciate her did little to endear him to me.  All the while, Alina nurses a hopeless and unrequited crush on him. Long after their paths part, she's still pining after him.  We're talking 50% of the book here, people. While I understood the reasons Alina loved Mal (they were orphans together and he was the only constant in her life growing up), I was never given a chance to love him as a reader.  The book opens with them traveling together but her training separates them almost immediately.  So her pining for him was more annoying than heartwarming.  Fortunately we do get a chance to get to know Mal a bit better later in the story, and he ends up being a pretty fantastic character, but I'm still going to keep rooting for Darkling because he was the one I got to know and care for first.",
                    "Shadow and Bone really is a fantastic story that deserves 100% of the acclaim it has received.  I'm still haunted by visions frozen forests and the chilling reaches of the Shadow Fold.  Despite my relatively minor character complaints, I loved the story and will gladly read it again.  I'll also be counting the days until the sequel.",
